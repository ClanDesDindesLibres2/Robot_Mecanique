# Mechanics: Robotic arm and Chessboard
Our project aims to **create a robotic chess opponent**. <br> To achieve this, a unique chessboard and a robotic arm were designed. <br> The design of these two **mechanical aspects** includes several **electrical aspects** as well.

## 1- Robotic Bras
### 1.1- Mechanics of the robotic arm
### 1.2- Electric robotic arm

## 2- Chessboard
### 2.1- Mechanics of the chessboard
#### Wooden Box
* The pieces are cut from a 1/4 inch board.
* The top of the box is cut and engraved with the file [top](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/top.svg).
* *Optional* The top piece is then placed face down in the cutter to engrave the guide lines for the electrical diagram on the bottom of the [top](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/top.svg)  file.
* The sides and the bottom are cut with the [sides](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/sides.svg)  and [bottom](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/bottom.svg)  files.
* *Additional* The last part to this wooden box is a drawer.
* The front side of the wooden box must be remaid with the file [sides_tiroir_ext](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/sides_tiroir_ext.svg).
* The following instructions explain the conception of the drawer inside the box.
#### Drawer
* The pieces are cut from 1/8 inch board.
* The drawer does not contain a top.
* The sides and the bottom of the drawer are cut with the file [sides_tiroir](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/sides_tiroir.svg) and [fond_tiroir](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/fond_tiroir.svg) respectively.
* All the pieces fit together and are glued with wood glue.
* The front of the drawer is glued to the interior of the outside face, [sides_tiroir_ext](https://github.com/ClanDesDindesLibres2/RoboticArm_ChessBoard_Mechanic/blob/main/Mechanical/WoodenBox/sides_tiroir_ext.svg), of the wooden box. 
    
* The different pieces fit together and are glued together using wood glue EXCEPT for the following:
   * The drawer door to the wooden box where it is written *Chess Bras*
   * The top of the box with the sides of the wooden box which allows access to the interior.
