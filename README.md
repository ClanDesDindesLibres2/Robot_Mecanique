# Mechanics: Robotic arm and Chessboard
Our project aims to **create a robotic chess opponent**. <br> To achieve this, a unique chessboard and a robotic arm were designed. <br> The design of these two **mechanical aspects** includes several **electrical aspects** as well.

## 1- Robotic Bras
### 1.1- Mechanics of the robotic arm
### 1.2- Electric robotic arm

## 2- Chessboard
### 2.1- Mechanics of the chessboard
#### Drawer
* The pieces are cut from 1/8 inch board.
* All the pieces fit together and are glued with wood glue.
#### Wooden Box
* The pieces are cut from a 1/4 inch board.
* The top of the box is cut and engraved with the file in file top1. 
* The cut piece is placed face down in the cutter to make the guide lines for the electrical diagram with the top2 file.
* The sides and the bottom are cut with the sides and bottom files.
* The last side with the drawer is cut with the file side_tiroir_ext. It is glued to the outside face of the previously assembled drawer.
* The different pieces fit together and are glued together using wood glue EXCEPT for the drawer door where it is written *Chess Bras* and the top of the box which allows access to the interior.
* These parts being removable, they are not fixed.

### 2.2- Electrical of the chessboard
